# Employee Management System (EMS)
### Project Abstract — Spring Boot REST API Training Project
**Prepared for:** DevSecOps Training — SBI
**Tech Stack:** Java 17 · Spring Boot 3.x · Spring Data JPA · MySQL · Spring Security · JWT · Lombok · Bean Validation · SpringDoc OpenAPI · Spring Actuator

---

## 1. Project Overview

The **Employee Management System (EMS)** is a RESTful web service built with Spring Boot that manages the core HR domain of an organization. It handles employees, their departments, their job roles, and the projects they are assigned to — through a clean, layered API.

EMS is the backbone Spring Boot project used across all training modules. The business domain is intentionally straightforward so that trainees can stay focused on the technology being taught at each stage, without getting lost in complex domain rules.

### Why This Project?

- **Universal domain** — everyone understands employees, departments, and projects
- **Relatable data** — names, emails, salaries, hire dates feel real without being sensitive
- **Progressive complexity** — start with basic CRUD, layer in security, validation, and monitoring
- **Multiple entity relationships** — covers One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many in one project
- **Security hooks** — salary and PII fields provide natural anchors for access control lessons

### Scope

The EMS API covers four core domains:

- **Employee** — the central entity; personal and employment information
- **Department** — organizational grouping of employees
- **Role** — job designation / seniority level within the organization
- **Project** — business initiatives that employees are assigned to

## 2. Business Context

Imagine a mid-sized organization that needs to manage its workforce digitally. The HR team needs to onboard new employees, organize them into departments, assign job roles that reflect their seniority, and track which projects each employee is working on at any given time.

Currently, this is done through spreadsheets and manual processes. The EMS API will serve as the backend system that powers an HR portal, replacing these manual processes with a secure, validated, and auditable REST API.

### 2.1 Business Problems Being Solved

| Problem | How EMS Solves It |
|---|---|
| No central employee registry | Single REST API with validated employee records in MySQL |
| No org structure visibility | Departments with assigned employees queryable via API |
| Role confusion in projects | Each employee carries an org Role; projects carry a separate `projectRole` per assignment |
| No project staffing tracker | Many-to-many Employee-Project assignments with dates and roles |
| Security and access gaps | Spring Security + JWT with role-based access control |

---

## 3. Entities and Data Model

The EMS domain consists of four entities that map directly to database tables via JPA.

### 3.1 Employee

The central entity of the system. Holds all personal and employment information about an individual.

| Field | Type | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Long | PK, Auto | Unique system identifier |
| `firstName` | String | NOT NULL | Employee's first name (2–50 chars) |
| `lastName` | String | NOT NULL | Employee's last name (2–50 chars) |
| `email` | String | NOT NULL, Unique | Business email; used as login identity |
| `phone` | String | Optional | Contact number in E.164-compatible format |
| `salary` | BigDecimal | NOT NULL | Monthly gross salary; PII — access-controlled |
| `hireDate` | LocalDate | NOT NULL | Date the employee joined the organization |
| `status` | Enum | NOT NULL | `ACTIVE` \| `INACTIVE` \| `ON_LEAVE` \| `TERMINATED` |
| `department` | Department | FK, NOT NULL | The department this employee belongs to |
| `role` | Role | FK, NOT NULL | The job role / designation of this employee |
| `createdAt` | LocalDateTime | Auto, Immutable | Timestamp of record creation (audit) |
| `updatedAt` | LocalDateTime | Auto | Timestamp of last record update (audit) |

### 3.2 Department

Represents an organizational unit. Deliberately kept simple — no hierarchy or manager relationship.

| Field | Type | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Long | PK, Auto | Unique system identifier |
| `name` | String | NOT NULL, Unique | Department name (e.g. Engineering, HR, Finance) |
| `description` | String | Optional | Short description of the department's function |

### 3.3 Role

Represents a job designation within the organization — not a Spring Security role. Carries a seniority level to enable sorting and access decisions.

| Field | Type | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Long | PK, Auto | Unique system identifier |
| `name` | String | NOT NULL, Unique | Designation name (e.g. `SENIOR_ENGINEER`, `HR_MANAGER`) |
| `description` | String | Optional | Details about the role's responsibilities |
| `level` | Integer | NOT NULL, 1–10 | Seniority level; 1 = Junior, 5 = Lead, 10 = Principal |

### 3.4 Project

Represents a business initiative. Employees are assigned to projects through the `EmployeeProject` join entity, which tracks when they were assigned and what role they play on that project.

| Field | Type | Constraint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Long | PK, Auto | Unique system identifier |
| `name` | String | NOT NULL, Unique | Project name (2–150 chars) |
| `description` | String | Optional | Summary of project objectives (up to 500 chars) |
| `startDate` | LocalDate | NOT NULL | Project kick-off date |
| `endDate` | LocalDate | Optional | Planned completion date; null for ongoing projects |
| `status` | Enum | NOT NULL | `PLANNED` \| `ACTIVE` \| `ON_HOLD` \| `COMPLETED` \| `CANCELLED` |
| `createdAt` | LocalDateTime | Auto, Immutable | Timestamp of record creation (audit) |
| `updatedAt` | LocalDateTime | Auto | Timestamp of last record update (audit) |

### 3.5 Relationships Summary

| From | Cardinality | To | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee | Many → One | Department | Many employees belong to one department |
| Employee | Many → One | Role | Many employees share one role designation |
| Employee | Many ↔ Many | Project | Via `EmployeeProject` — carries `assignedDate` + `projectRole` |

## 7. Key Business Rules

### 7.1 Employee Rules

- Every employee must belong to exactly one department and one role at all times
- Email addresses must be unique across the entire system
- Salary must be a positive value stored as `BigDecimal` (never `float` or `double`)
- An employee cannot be deleted — status is set to `TERMINATED` instead (soft delete)
- Hire date cannot be set to a future date
- Salary is a sensitive (PII) field — visible only to the employee themselves and HR Admins

### 7.2 Department and Role Rules

- Department names must be unique
- A department cannot be deleted if it has active employees assigned to it
- Role names must be unique; level must be between 1 and 10
- A role cannot be deleted if employees are currently assigned to it

### 7.3 Project Rules

- Project names must be unique
- If an end date is provided, it must be after the start date
- An employee cannot be assigned to the same project more than once
- A project cannot move directly from `PLANNED` to `COMPLETED` — must pass through `ACTIVE`
- Deleting a project removes all associated employee assignments
